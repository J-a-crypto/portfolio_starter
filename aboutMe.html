      HERE IS SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON WHO I AM...

    <div class="Bio">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          I AM A 17 YEAR OLD LATINO LIVING IN RIDGEWOOD, QUEENS. BOTH OF MY
          PARENTS ARE FROM ECUADOR. I LIKE DRAWING, LISTENING TO MUSIC, AND
          PLAYING BOTH SPORTS AND VIDEO GAMES WITH MY FRIENDS. I HAVE THREE
          BROTHERS, MY TWO YOUNGEST BROTHERS LIVE HERE BUT MY OLDER BROTHER
          LIVES ALL THE WAY IN ECUADOR. A MAJORITY OF MY LIFE I HAVE LIVED IN
          RIDGEWOOD WHERE I MET MANY FRIENDS AND MADE MANY MEMORIES. IN SCHOOL,
          I PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THE WORK THAT IS GIVEN TO ME AND
          SOCIALIZING WITH A SPECIFIC GROUP OF FRIENDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I GET HIGH GRADES ON EVERY SUBJECT AND MAKE IT ON THE HONOR ROLL FOR
          EACH TRIMESTER. I'M A QUIET KID IN CLASS BUT WHEN I HAVE FRIENDS THAT
          I USUALLY TALK TO, THAT BARRIER THAT IS KEEPING ME FROM TALKING IS
          GONE AND I JUST TALK FREELY. I AM WILLING TO PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT TO
          ENSURE THAT I LAND A GREAT JOB WHICH WILL SUPPORT MY FAMILY AND
          MYSELF. I WANT TO MEET MY MOTHER'S EXPECTATIONS AND PAY HER BACK FOR
          EVERYTHING SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH JUST FOR ME AND MY BROTHERS. I WANT TO
          MAKE MY FAMILY PROUD AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THEM ALL THE WAY WITH MY
          EFFORTS.
